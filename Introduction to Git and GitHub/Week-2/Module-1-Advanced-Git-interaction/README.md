# Advanced Git Cheat Sheet

There are many useful git cheatsheets online as well. Please take some time to research and study a few, such as [this one](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

__.gitignore files__

.gitignore files are used to tell the git tool to intentionally ignore some files in a given Git repository. For example, this can be useful for configuration files or metadata files that a user may not want to check into the master branch. Check out more: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

A few common examples of file patterns to exclude can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657).
