# Merging

- **Merging** is the term that uses for combining branched data and history together.
- When we are at the current working branch uses `git merge <branchname>` to merge an identified branch to your current working branch.
- Git uses two different algorithms to perform a merge: __fast-forward__ and __three-way merge__.
