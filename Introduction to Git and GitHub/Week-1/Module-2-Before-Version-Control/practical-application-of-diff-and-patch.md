# Mini Quiz: Practical Application of diff and patch
1. We've prepared a diff file with the changes that need to be applied to the script. What does our colleague need to do now?
- [ ] Look at the changes in the diff file and manually modify the original file with those same changes.
- [ ] Run diff disk_usage.py disk_usage.py.
- [ ] Ask us to send them the full file, not just the diff file.
- [x] Run patch disk_usage.py < disk_usage.diff.
